# **Apache Spark: SQL language with using Spark SQL functions**

## Applied Data Science in Logistics with Spark SQL

A carrier has several vehicles that are used for deliveries. Each vehicle makes several deliveries per day and the exact time of each delivery is recorded. 
The company tries to optimize the route of each vehicle by having the same vehicle make all deliveries in each region, thus reducing the time between one delivery and another.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

In this project, the objective is to analyze a dataset of a carrier responsible for delivering products. 
Different vehicles make different deliveries at different times of the day.
Using Spark SQL we will extract insights and understand how the company's delivery logistics are performing.

***
## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The solutions for each business question are presented in SQL Language and using Spark SQL functions.
Topics such as aggregation, Window functions, and date parsing are also covered.

The data used in this work are fictitious and the dataset has 3 columns: 
* vehicle id, 
* the delivery that was made
* time

Using Spark SQL, we will perform a series of analyzes on the data in order to verify how the company's delivery logistics are performing.
